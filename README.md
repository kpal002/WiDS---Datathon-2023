# WiDS---Datathon-2023
My approach and solution for the Datathon organized as part of the 6th Annual Women in Data Science (WiDS) Stanford Conference to be held on March 8, 2023

I took part in a two-day datathon organised by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as part of the Stanford University's worldwide annual conference. 

The challenge focused on longer-term weather forecasting to help communities adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change. The dataset was created in collaboration with [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://www.climatechange.ai). Participants will submit forecasts of temperature and precipitation for one year, competing against the other teams as well as official forecasts from NOAA.

## What does EDA reveal?

- The dataset has a total of 245 features. 
- **Target:** The arithmetic mean of the max and min observed temperature over the next 14 days for each location and start date, computed as '''(measured max temperature + measured mini temperature) / 2'''
